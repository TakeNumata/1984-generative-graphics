Folder to for experimental code that uses OpenPose to get back estimatated position data from webcam movements. 
## Source code 
* [OpenPose_PythonOpenCV](https://github.com/nishagandhi/OpenPose_PythonOpenCV) - a simple code demonstrating real time position estimation (but uses methods from OpenPose that have been deprecated)
* [OpenPose Python API Examples](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/tree/master/examples/tutorial_api_python) - examples using the OpenPose Python API (I mostly referenced [this file](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/blob/master/examples/tutorial_api_python/01_body_from_image.py))
