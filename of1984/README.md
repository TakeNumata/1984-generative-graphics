## Source code 
Most of the source code that I used came from [Lewis Lepton's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8Wzk_R1GoPkPqLo-obU_kQ) two tutorial on OpenFramworks. The first one is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwt2NAd1ZYY&list=PL4neAtv21WOlqpDzGqbGM_WN2hc5ZaVv7) and the second one is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKSTo_0pB28&list=PL4neAtv21WOmrV8z9rSzL20QpdLU1zJLr). The source code for all these tutorial are [here](https://github.com/lewislepton/openFrameworksTutorialSeries).
