# OPENFRAMEWORKS
Code for generating custom generative graphics. Written in C++ using OpenFramworks
## Source code 
-  [Lewis Lepton's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8Wzk_R1GoPkPqLo-obU_kQ) two tutorial on OpenFramworks. The first one is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwt2NAd1ZYY&list=PL4neAtv21WOlqpDzGqbGM_WN2hc5ZaVv7) and the second one is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKSTo_0pB28&list=PL4neAtv21WOmrV8z9rSzL20QpdLU1zJLr).

 ## DEPENDENCIES
 OpenFramworks - [website](https://openframeworks.cc)
 
 ## SETUP
 1. Install OpenFramworks - [instructions](https://openframeworks.cc/download/). For OSX users, download the nightlyupdate version, as this allows you to use OF without having the trouble on configuring the certificates and code signing.
 2. Download openframeworks addons. These should be downloaded into the addons folder
  - [ofxCv](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxCv)
  - [ofxBox2d](https://github.com/vanderlin/ofxBox2d)
 3. With the download come an application called the Project Generator (located in projectGenerator folder). Open the application, and click the import button. Import the project from where you downloaded it from, and open in preferred IDE

## ISSUES
1. Some of the contours from OpenCV does not work properly (not detecting the right thing). Will be doing more work on this part.
